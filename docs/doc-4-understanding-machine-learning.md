#### Specificity
- **Purpose**: How well does model avoid false alarms?
- **Formula**: True Negatives Ã· (True Negatives + False Positives)
- **Use Case**: Email spam filters - better to let spam through than delete real emails

ðŸ’¡ **Interview Hint**: "Choose metrics based on business cost of different types of errors"
ðŸ’¡ **Memory Cue**: Sensitivity = Catching the bad guys, Specificity = Not bothering the good guys

### Regression Evaluation
- **Goal**: Minimize difference between predicted and actual values
- **Visualization**: Distance between data points and prediction line
- **Common Metric**: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- **Interpretation**: Smaller error = better model performance

### Unsupervised Learning Evaluation
- **Challenge**: No "correct" answers to compare against
- **Approach**: Evaluate based on business objectives
- **Examples**:
  - Do clusters make business sense?
  - Do anomalies represent real problems?
  - Do associations lead to actionable insights?

ðŸ’¡ **Interview Hint**: "Unsupervised evaluation is subjective - does it solve your business problem?"

## Improving Model Performance
