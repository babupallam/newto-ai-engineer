     - Remove errors and inconsistencies
     - Format data properly for AI systems

5. **Continuous Learning**: How can AI systems continue to learn and adapt after initial training?
   - Online learning: Updating models with new data streams
     - AI continues learning from new data as it arrives
     - Adapts to changing conditions over time
   - Transfer learning: Applying knowledge to new domains
     - Uses knowledge from one task to help with related tasks
     - Like using language skills to learn a new language
   - Active learning: Selecting most informative examples
     - AI chooses which new examples would be most helpful to learn from
     - Focuses learning on most important cases

## Listen and Learn

1. **Speech Recognition**: How do AI systems convert speech to text, and what are the main challenges?
   - Deep neural networks analyze audio waveforms and extract features
     - AI processes sound waves like human ears and brain
     - Identifies patterns in audio that correspond to speech sounds
   - Map acoustic patterns to phonemes and words
     - Phonemes are basic speech sounds (like "ah" or "th")
     - Combines phonemes to form words and sentences
   - Challenges: Background noise, accents, speaking speed variations
     - Noise makes it hard to hear speech clearly
     - Different accents pronounce words differently
     - People speak at different speeds and volumes
   - Distinguishing similar-sounding words and handling context
     - Words like "to," "too," and "two" sound the same
     - Need context to understand which word is meant

2. **Voice Assistants**: Explain the AI technologies behind virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant.
   - Speech recognition to understand spoken commands
     - Converts your voice into text the computer can process
     - Handles different accents and speaking styles
   - Natural language processing to interpret intent
     - Understands what you're asking for
     - Handles different ways of asking the same question
   - Knowledge graphs for information retrieval
     - Vast databases of facts and relationships
     - Quickly finds relevant information to answer questions
   - Text-to-speech for responses and machine learning for personalization
     - Converts text responses back into natural-sounding speech
     - Learns your preferences and speaking patterns over time

3. **Audio Processing**: What AI techniques are used for music recommendation and audio analysis?
   - Collaborative filtering based on similar user preferences
     - "People who liked this song also liked..."
     - Finds users with similar tastes and recommends their favorites
   - Content-based analysis of audio features (tempo, genre)
     - Analyzes the actual sound characteristics of music
     - Tempo, rhythm, instruments, vocal style, etc.
   - Deep learning for audio fingerprinting and classification
     - Creates unique "fingerprints" for each song
     - Automatically categorizes music by genre, mood, etc.
   - Spectral analysis and pattern recognition techniques
     - Breaks down audio into frequency components
     - Identifies patterns that characterize different types of sounds
