## 🧩 **Algorithms**

**Definition:**
An algorithm is a **set of step-by-step instructions** that tell a system how to process inputs and produce outputs.

**Flow:**
👉 **Input → Process (instructions) → Output**

**Computer Science vs AI Algorithms**

* **Traditional algorithms:** Follow fixed rules written by humans (e.g., sorting numbers, searching data).

**Key Steps of a Data Strategy:**

1. **Set data-oriented objectives** – Define what business problems data will solve.
2. **Identify necessary data** – What kind of data is needed (sales, customer behavior, IoT signals, etc.)?
3. **Determine data sources and types** – Internal databases, sensors, APIs, user feedback, etc.
4. **Apply analytics:**

   * **Predictive analysis** → Forecast what’s likely to happen.
   * **Prescriptive analysis** → Recommend actions to optimize results.
5. **Operationalize data-driven processes** – Embed analytics into daily workflows.

💡 *Interview Hint:*
